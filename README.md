# Savvy Stats
A statistical package built in and for JavaScript.  The current library is under development.  Please see the [Savvy Stats Website](http://savvystats.tk) for complete documentation on the current package and a playground to explore the library in.

## Dependency
In order to perform some of the calculations for the statistical library in JavaScript, Savvy Stats depends on [mathjs (Copyright (C) 2013-2015 Jos de Jong wjosdejong@gmail.com)](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) for some of its calculations.  A big shoutout to Jos de Jong for providing this fantastic library for working with high-level mathematical calculations on very large and very small integers and rationals.
